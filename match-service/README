# Setup

Configuration is kept in the file ../conf.js, this includes:

* The URI for the base LDP container.

* The URI for the WSI (Workset Services Index)

* Default URIs for Target WorkSet and Target Fragment

To create a WSI, set the base in conf.js and use:

  node create-wsi

# Match services

## Key Match service

To create matches for all fragment in a workset run as:

node keymatch.js ALL <workset-uri>

To run just one added fragment:

node keymatch.js <workset-uri> <target-fragment>

## Length Match service

To create matches for all fragment in a workset run as:

node lengthmatch.js ALL <workset-uri>

To run just one added fragment:

node lengthmatch.js <workset-uri> <target-fragment>

## Instrument Match service

To create matches for all fragments that are playable by an instrument:

node instrumentmatch.js <workset-uri> <instrument-uri>

# Utilities

* To fetch FragRefs from a container and resolve them to a list of Fragments:

  node listfrags WORKSET-URI

* Utility to remove all items from an LDP container:

  node emptycontainer CONTAINER-URI

* Find an annotation matching TARGET in CONTAINER

  node findAnn CONTAINER-URI TARGET-URI

* Find matches in a MatchService container (dealing with recursion on a motivation of ninre:seeHere):

  node findMatches CONTAINER-URI TARGET-URI
