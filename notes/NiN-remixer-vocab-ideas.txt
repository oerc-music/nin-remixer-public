# Notes on vocabulary choices

Going through the various parts of the architecture diagram:

Fragments from NiN:
  What is called a "DMO"
  Music Ontology to reference the score as MEI
  PROV for the "provenance metadata"

Matched Fragments:
  Represent matches as annotations
  Some kinds of match can be recorded by relating two fragments to a shared concept
    the "compatible key" match is probably included

Working sets:
  A set of fragments used in a Remixer session
    may include one or more previously defined sets
  LDP container(?) with references to include the Fragment DMOs
    can we include by reference the previously defined containers
    (do these change over time?)

Assembled score
  Can use the Segment ontology to map the use of fragments in the composition?

Output DMO
  Similar Provenance information to the input DMOs
