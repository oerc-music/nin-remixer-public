# Notes on vocabulary choices

Going through the various parts of the architecture diagram:

Fragments from NiN:
  What is called a "DMO"
  Music Ontology to reference the score as MEI
  PROV for the "provenance metadata"
  Probably local vocab for the specifics of the metadata
  (still need to map this)

Matched Fragments:
  Represent matches as annotations
  Some kinds of match can be recorded by relating two fragments to a shared concept
    the "compatible key" match is probably included
    there are concepts in the Chord Ontology (http://purl.org/ontology/chord/) which relate to the scales and could be useful
    there is also a Keys Ontology refered to by Music Ontology (http://purl.org/NET/c4dm/keys.owl)
  Other kinds of match may need need to be a pairwise 
    in which case only make sense within a "working set"
    (a consideration for the Architecture)

Working sets:
  A set of fragments used in a Remixer session
    may include one or more previously defined sets
  LDP container(?) with references to include the Fragment DMOs
    can we include by reference the previously defined containers
    (do these change over time?)

Assembled score
  Can use the Segment ontology to map the use of fragments in the composition?
  [Segment Ontology not currently online at: https://www.linkedmusic.org/ontologies]

Output DMO
  Similar Provenance information to the input DMOs
    human decisions in creating the composition
    also capture the working sets under consideration
  Reference created MEI of the whole output
    and also input fragments used
    (the assembled score information)
