# Minimal demonstrable product scenario

- export a number of "piano roll" fragments from Numbers into Notes

- start nin-remixer with a (possibly empty) collection of fragments available (selected?) [as a working set?]

- play some of the working set fragments

- select an initial fragment to be part of the composition; fragment is inserted into an open-ended timeline.  

- System places cursor following the inserted fragment

- system offers compatible fragments to appear at the cursor

    - e.g. based on "compatible" key

- User may:
    
    - listen to any of the offered fragments 
    - select one of the offered fragments to be inserted into the timeline
    - remove last fragment from the composition
    - play the entire composition so far

- Repeat and rinse

- export resulting composition as "DMO" (maybe as link, or maybe as data)
