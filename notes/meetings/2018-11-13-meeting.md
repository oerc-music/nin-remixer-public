## Review of SOFA status w.r.t. previously articulated goals

### Completed

- Fragment selection and addition to a score from options offered by constraint filters.

- Multi-voice audio generation.  This is now working by virtue of dropping midi.js and using the soundfont player library directly.

- Note generation that reflects key signature.  This is now working by using MIDI note numbers supplied by NiN, passed in MEI @pnum attributes.

- Deployment images and scripts for SOFA and Numnbers into Notes demo systems.  Implemented based on Docker images

- Gather instrument list from pitch-range matching service.  Also filters instruments presented based on note ranges of available fragments.

- Basic UI for selecting fragments and addiung them to the score under construction (may need to be updated).

- Basic UI for selecting constraiunts to be used tio filter fragments available for selection at any particular cell (will probably be updated - see future considerations).

- Annotation agent for pitch-range compatibility with specified instrument.

- LDP recursive scanning, allowing constraiunts to be groupoed by sub-categories.

### Left over from SAAM / Industry day activities

@@@Update this; text currently reordered from prevuious minutes; move any completed tasks ^^ @@@

- Stable or landmark state software releases in github, tagged.

    0.1 day?  Still need to push tags.

- Session save and reload, including UI

    2 days

- Session setup UI, including location of working set and assignment of instruments to each channel. Channel count currently fixed at 3, should be selectable.

    2 days to design and implement channel addition and removal.

- GitHub reported security vulnerabilities in library dependencies (see https://github.com/oerc-music/nin-remixer-public/notifications)

    0.5 day?

- Insert (and remove?) column in score

    1 day for simple case

    May need subsequent investigation and design outline if simple case isn't adequate.

- When changing selected instrument for channel, highlighnt arrangments that are incompatible with the new instrument

- Review and tweak interface

    Open-ended?

- Design and implementation of NiN output to Working Sets, and triggers for annotation agents to evaluate new fragments as they are added.

    Needs design outline before we can estimate.  DDeR may have some input to this.

- Multiple working sets input, and corresponding updates to the SOFA presentation of fragments.

    Needs some thinking about UX aspects: how should this appear to users?

- Generate MEI document for assembled score

    Needs more investigation to estimate (MEI is complicated; issues like key signature selection arise.)


### Future considerations

(Not estimated - generally these need more investigation and design work before it makes sense to estimate implementation effort.)

- Authenticated access to LDP, and access control for working sets and sessions

- DDeR ideas for deploying SOFA as a public service, with logging so that we can gather information about how people use it.

- Annotation agents adding information derived from audio processing - assumes we have source audio to be analyzed.

- Instrument setup based on predefined ensembles?  (This was dropped from earlier plans.)

- Present available and active compatibility filters, with selection option for those that are selectable. 

- Continuous monitoring of working set contents so that annotation agents can analyze new fragments as they are added.  See also "NiN output to Working Sets".  This masy require careful engineering to scale up appropriately - see "scaling up".

- Scaling up: refine LDP usage to deal with larger collections of fragments.

- Make LDP access elements part of the MELD libraries.


## Brief retrospective and lessons arising

@@@Anything to add/update?

- LDP works well in principle, but possible issues with performance.  No querying.  This all has implications for the SOFA implementation architecture.

- LDP scanning performance isn't great - need to re-engineer to scale up acceptably.  So far, we haven't considered scaling issues in our implementation architecture.

- Currently GOLD in debug mode and no authentication or access control

- GOLD is looking a bit like abandonware.  The Node-based LDP library looks more actively maintained.

- MEI handling is harder than it looks.  Music is messy.

- Midi.js was not really suitable for our purposes.  The underlying soundfont player library seems to be a better fit, and is what SOFA currently uses.


## DMRN poster status

@@@Previously on the SOFA:

In discussion with Kevin, we agreed to propose a poster, maybe something like "SOFA: Enabling Music Flows with Digital Music Objects"
