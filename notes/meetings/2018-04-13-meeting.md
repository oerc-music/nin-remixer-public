Resolved to defer DMO Export and Multi-working set import to after demo rehearsal on 2018-04-26.

### Previous actions carried forward

- [ ] 20180322.4   JP: Add notes about proposal for NiN export triggers to GitHub
      - non-urgent, may be allowed to drift
- [ ] 20180322.8   JP: Multiple/additional working set import and basic display
      - deferred until after demo rehearsal

- [ ] 20180328.5   JP Simple fragment compatibility service implementation (1-1.5d)
    - in progress; effort re-assessed
- [ ] 20180328.6   JP Fragment assembly / internal score generation (UI and logic) (0.5d)
    - in progress
- [ ] 20180328.7   JP MEI document generation from internal score (1.0d)
    - looked at what is required; reassessed effort
- [ ] 20180328.8   JP Audio generation from MEI score (0.5d)
    - looked at previous working code; conluded that it should port OK.
- [ ] 20180328.9   JP Multiple working set import and basic display (0.5d)
    - not started yet

### New actions

- [ ] 20180413.1  GK review and publish meeting notes
- [ ] 20180413.2  GK progress summary email Kevin (SAAM)
- [ ] 20180413.3  JP authenticated access to LDP
    - not an immediate requirement, but should be addressed before allowing external access to remixer.  Will probably be provided via HTTP server proxy.

(Other actions are continuation of current development work.)

### Next meeting

Previous meeting: [2018-03-28](./2018-03-28-meeting.md)

### Previous actions carried forward

- [ ] 20180322.4   JP: Add notes about proposal for NiN export triggers to GitHub
      - this isn't so urgent, may be allowed to drift
- [ ] 20180322.8   JP: Multiple/additional working set import and basic display
      - No activity, ongoing, not a vast amount of work to complete, but not urgent
      - deferred until after demo rehearsal
- [x] 20180322.10  JP: Initial fragment compatibility service implementation
      - ongoing; superseded by new actions

### Actions from last meeting

## Review software progress and blockers

### Fragment comlatibility service

Client side logic for LDP interactions (see diags) is being implemented as a service in Node.

Taking longer than planned..  Learning curve using Node for service implementation, to allow more re-use of code (i.e. all in JS).

Have working:

- container creation
- annotation creation

To do:

- chasing down the container chain
- collect annotations targeting a resource

### Fragment assembly interface

Work on interface and associated logic: fragment assembly.

Have working:

- display list of working set contents (fragements)
- local filtering logic, but lacking actual filter function

To do:

- filter function on container contents, based on annotation target

### Numbers into Notes data exports

(Previously unscheduled, except as vague "integration and testing")

Have made some changes to the NiN data export to generate sensible data fragment outputs that can be consumed by the remixer.
(Dealing with CORS issues, fixed formatting errors, etc.)

## Readiness for SAAM paper

From the original schedule DMO Export logic/UI and multiple working set import have been deferred until after the demo reheasal day.

We have fair confidence that what remains, which may constitute a suitable basis for discussing additional work for SAAM, will be working in basic form by 2018-04-20.

## Next steps and timeline

NOTE: industry day demo trial run is 2018-04-26

### Next week timeline

Simple fragment compatibility service
- Aim to complete by early next week (original estimate rather optimistic, but work is also folding in activities that were previously estimated separately) (1-1.5d)

Core UI for remixer
- fragment assembly / score generation (UI to build internal composed sequence - activity is running in parallel with compatibility service implementation) (0.5d)

Then need MEI generation.  Have looked more at what is required; revised estimate. (1d)
- generic MEI might still be challenging, but the specific MEI from NiN looks easy enough.

Audio generation from current "score"
- requires MEI; have pieces available to play MEI (with bug) (0.5d)

Core UI for remixer
- audio playback (roll in to previous)

### Overall rough timeline

- Week 5: (starting Mon 2018-04-16)

    Core UI for remixer
    - finish fragment assembly / score generation
    MEI document generation ("score")
    Audio generation from current "score"
    Core UI for remixer
    - audio playback

    Integration, testing and improvement
    Minimum viable product (MVP) demoable

    (Ready for meeting to think about additional work for SAAM paper?)

- Week 6: (starting 2018-04-23)

    Minimum viable product (MVP) reviewed and tweaked, and ready for demo rehearsal.

- Deferred to later

    DMO Export logic
    Core UI for remixer
    - DMO export

    Core UI for remixer
    - multiple working set import and basic display (0.5d)
    - (not urgent for demo)
