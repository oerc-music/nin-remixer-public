# Summary and general notes

The SOFA load/save UI is progressing in line with last week's revised estimate.  Code is mostly complete, with a day's worth of integration/testing to wrap up.

We have continued progress on installing Solid and creation of a command line tool for creating and accessing MELD structures in an LDP/Solid server.  Focus has been on adding features that can be used in testing of MELD applications (i.e. commands to access container contents, and to test resource representation text or RDF contents).

Kevin is currently trying to round up dates for a meeting with QMUL about a SOFA-ized version of CALMA.  Current candidates are 19/20/21 March.

Activities to think about in prepaation for the QMUL meeting:

- working set and match service annotation structure diagram to support SOFA/LDP interaction descriptions (cf. [GK4])
- meld-cli tool, work with Gold?  OR...
- SOFA running on Solid (plan to try this on 2019-03-12 with GK+JP in office).  See [GK9].
- Consider what additional features in MELD CLI tool will allow creation of match/annotation services as bash scripts.
- (more?)

# GK

## Previously

- Review/document SOFA access patterns to LDP/Solid storage (for CALMA, etc) [GK4, GK8]
- MELD CLI tool - create annotation, test text resource content, test RDF resource content [GK5, GK6, GK7, GK1]

## Next/future

- QMul meeting for MELD/CALMA?  (2019-03-20/21 - under discussion)
- MELD CLI tool test suite (Started)
- Add annotation display to MELD CLI tool
- Generic resource creation in MELD CLI tool
- Setup Solid with proper localhost certificate
- Improve documentation of Solid and MELD CLI tool setup
- ???

## Blockers

(None at present)


# JP

## Previously

Spent 2d in SOFA save/load - nearly done, but final integration and testing to pull it all together.  Expecting 1 more day to wrap up.  No blockers.  (This is in line with revised plan from previous meeting.)

## Next

- finish up SOFA save/load implementation [JP4, JP5]
- Scripts for merging worksets for multiple inputs to a SOFA session [JP6]
    - Will probably look at adding this to MELD-CLI tool [GK5].
- Scripts for merging worksets for multiple inputs to a SOFA session [JP6]


## Blockers
