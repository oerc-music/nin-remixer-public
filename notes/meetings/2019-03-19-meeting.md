# Summary and general notes

The SOFA load/save UI work has stalled due to problems with loading data into GOLD.  Code is mostly complete, with a day's worth of integration/testing to wrap up. 

We had already planned to try running SOFA on node-solid-server later today:  if this works, we'll try switching development to that to sidestep the problems with GOLD.

A date for meeting with QMUL about MELD/CALMA has been set for next week (19 Mar).

Mat will look at generating a larger SOFA dataset for demonstration use.

Activities to think about in preparation for the QMUL meeting:

- working set and match service annotation structure diagram to support SOFA/LDP interaction descriptions (cf. [GK4])
- meld-cli tool, work with Gold?  OR...
- SOFA running on Solid (plan to try this on 2019-03-12 with GK+JP in office).  See [GK9].
- Consider what additional features in MELD CLI tool will allow creation of match/annotation services as bash scripts.
- (more?)


# GK

## Previously

- created bash test suite for meld-cli.js
- continuing to add functionality to meld-cli.js (ongoing)
- generic resource creation in MELD CLI tool
- submitting Solid bug reports (content negotiation and HTTP HEAD)

Other:
- Annalist support language-tagged literals
- Annalist GitHub login

## Next/future

- MELD/CALMA meeting at QMUL on 2019-03-19
- Setup Solid with proper CA localhost certificate and document for JP
- Ongoing enhancements to meld-cli
    - Add annotation display to MELD CLI tool
    - More SOFA-specific features
    - Improve documentation of Solid and MELD CLI tool setup
- Annalist Solid login
- ???


## Blockers

(None at present)


# JP

## Previously

- Install Node Solid server; try running SOFA on Solid
- SOFA now runs under Solid, and appears to be more stable.  Also faster!
   - needs pushing to github
- Still need to merge code to finish up SOFA save/load implementation [JP4, JP5]
- Held a session with MW to identify locus of code changes in NiN code.
    - Mat is making changes in NiN fork [oerc-music/NumbersIntoNotes, thalassa branch](https://github.com/oerc-music/NumbersIntoNotes/tree/thalassa-version)
    - This may be mereged into main NiN in due course (discretion of DDeR)
- Merged Mat's presentation updates to branch with changes for Solid deployment (master)

## Next

- update installation kit and instructions as required (0.5d)
- with working system; push changes to GitHub
- wrap up Solid-based deployment in a Docker container

Future:

- Scripts for merging worksets for multiple inputs to a SOFA session [JP6]
    - Will probably look at adding this to MELD-CLI tool [GK5].
- Finish off MEI output

## Blockers

(None)

# MW

(Not present, notes mainly from last week)

## Previously

- style and presentation changes to SOFA; pushed to GitHub
- Had meeting with JP about NiN changes

## Next

- Generate a larger dataset for SOFA demonstration (more fragments, more chance of matching) - automatic generation from NiN

## Blockers
