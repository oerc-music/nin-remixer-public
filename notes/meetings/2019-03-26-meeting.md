# Summary and general notes

We held a MELD/CALMA meeting at QMUL on 2019-03-19, and have plans for a series of future meetings and teleconferences.  Next substantial activity will be a working meeting on 2019-04-03, where we hope to make a start on SOFA agent(s) for CALMA.

SOFA is now running on Solid, and a Solid docker container has been assembled.

Some progress on load/save integration in SOFA.  Expect to wrap up this week.

Some small progress made on the SOFA/MELD CLI tool and test suite, mainly testing and debugging.
