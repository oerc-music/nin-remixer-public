## Review actions

- [ ] Review actions; note any issues or blockers
    - Deciding which pending actions should be carried forward
    - Look at list of task planning (2018-05-02-JP-DW-task-planning.md)
    - Formulate new list of actions to carry forward

### Previous actions carried forward

(Actions obviously overtaken by events have been dropped; most of these should be subsumed into a new development plan.)

- [ ] 20180322.4  JP: Add notes about proposal for NiN export triggers to GitHub
    - SHOULD HAVE (would be good for demo)
- [ ] 20180322.8  JP: Multiple/additional working set import and basic display
      - No activity, ongoing, not a vast amount of work to complete, but not urgent
      - NICE TO HAVE for demo
- [x] 20180328.6  JP Fragment assembly / internal score generation (UI and logic)
      - Subsumed by later planning
- [ ] 20180328.7  JP MEI document generation from internal score
      - SHOULD HAVE for demo (but maybe not very visible in demo)
      - NOTE: now assembling multi-part MEI score - affects effort required
      - NOTE: may be affected by decision on action 20180328.8
- [ ] 20180328.8  JP Audio generation from assembled MEI score
      - DEFER consideration: may be superseded by alternative playback optiuon
      - (also note playback is now multi-channel)
- [ ] 20180413.3  JP authenticated access to LDP
    - NOT REQUIRED for demo; but should be addressed before allowing external access to Sofa.  Will probably be provided via HTTP server proxy.
- [x] 20180423.2  JP complete UI for remixer and fregment assembly
      - Subsumed by later planning and design changes
- [x] 20180423.3  JP complete check MEI output and functionality
      - Subsumed by later planning and design changes
- [x] 20180423.4  JP complete and test audio generation from MEI
      - Subsumed by later planning and design changes
      - MUST HAVE audio generation in some form

### Actions from last meeting

n/a

### Additional actions for planning

Column constraints:
    - matching fragment lengths (implicit, no UI)
    - choose other constraints from those available

Row constraints:
    - instrument playability (session setup)
    - key compatibility (enable or not - "stick or twist")
    - choose other constraints from those available ("stick or twist")

UI elements to consider: session setup, column constraints, fragment selection pop-up "stick or twist"

- [ ] 20180615.1  JP UI to display multiple parts (rows in grid)
    - MUST HAVE
    - in progress
- [ ] 20180615.2  JP Code to handle column constraints over fragment grid
    - MUST HAVE
    - in progress
- [ ] 20180615.3  JP Code to handle row constraints over fragment grid
    - MUST HAVE
    - in progress
- [ ] 20180615.4  JP code to handle session setup (session-wide constraint selection)
    - SHOULD HAVE (possible to hard-code?)
    - not stareted
- [ ] 20180615.5  JP recursive scanning of LDP containers
    - MUST HAVE (because of way agents generate annotations)
    - agents can create; interface filter code in progress
- [ ] 20180615.6  GK extend Annalist musical instrument catalogue to contain ensemble descriptions
    - SHOULD HAVE - see 20180615.7
- [ ] 20180615.7  JP create agent to read ensemble descriptions and generate LDP container to drive remixer UI.  Needs some design work.
    - NICE TO HAVE - demo could use hard-coded instruments for channels OR demo could have specific UI to read Annalist data directly for choices (requires constraint-specific logic in the remixer)
- [ ] 20180615.8  Session setup UI to allow instrument/channel selection
    - NICE TO HAVE - demo could use hard-coded instruments for channels; see also 20180615.7
- [ ] 20180615.9  JP Decide on approach for specifying instrument group (see above three actions .6-.8)
- [ ] 20180615.10 JP Add compatibility agent (annotation service) for instrumentation 
    - MUST HAVE
    - in progress - needs linking to Annalist data


## Review software progress and blockers

Mainly, pick of items hanging over from Sofa paper work

See actions above for specific software components.

Progress has been adversely impacted by VM infrastructure problems.  Currently have NiN running from docker container in desktop.  Still need to set up dockerized LDP containerthat can be run on the system under JP's desktop.  Thus, the docklerized systems can easily be moved to a new VM when that stalilizes.

Compatibility agents for length, key compatibility, etc...  Currently these are run by hand as stand-alone command line applications, paramaterized with working set URI and compatibility service URI. Currently no triggers to auto-run whennew fragment is created.  Currently being run by checking out to some suitable host and run using node.  Could have copies ready-to-run (with node installed) on the demo server.

GK Q: could NiN installation be easier?  Yes, as a docker container.  Hard-coded config configuratiobn is now concentrated in a single config file.  Could use docker files to generate install script.  But a full install package is probably too much effort.  (Will be in Github later today)

Sofa remixer application is all browser side Javascript: needs to be served from somewhere, after transpiling (node server does this on-the fly, but could be pre-built and served statically.)  Therefore currently needs node server to serve content.  Need to have node server for demo server.

Currently agents access Annalist data on fast-project.annalist.net. Could be posisbly configured to use static data export.

ACTION:
- [ ] 20180615.11 JP need complete installation guide for setting up all the software for a stand-alone demo deployment.  Some of this could be pre-build or scripted.

## Planning for Industry day demo

Note: fully functional demo should be stabilized by 17 August - 10 elapsed weeks from date of this meeting.

(Note Mark Sandler visit on 20 Jun (2+ days)

### Software development plan


Make note of tasks to be completed for the demo

MUST HAVE / NEEDED

- UI to interact with multiple parts (rows in grid) - 1-2d

- Filter function and tie-in to UI for row/column constraints in fragment grid - 1d

- Set up data for demonstraton

- UI elements to set up constraints

- Audio generation for assembled fragments - MUST HAVE, design needed

- Handle session setup - MUST HAVE

- Recursive scanning of LDP containers - MUST HAVE

- Compatibility agent (annotation service) for instrumentation  - MUST HAVE


SHOULD HAVE

- NiN export triggers - SHOULD HAVE (would be good for demo)

- MEI document generation from assembled fragments - SHOULD HAVE for demo (but maybe not very visible in demo)

- Extend Annalist musical instrument catalogue to contain ensemble descriptions - SHOULD HAVE

- Create some ensemble data - SHOULD HAVE


NICE TO HAVE

- Create agent to read ensemble descriptions and generate LDP container - NICE TO HAVE, needs design

- Session setup UI to allow instrument/channel selection - NICE TO HAVE

- Multiple/additional working set import - NICE TO HAVE for demo

- Authenticated access to LDP - NOT REQUIRED for demo


### Other tasks required for industry day


## Risks to maintaining progress

Identify potential risks; which can reasonably be mitigated?
(Note: Mat offered to do a trial install of the software)
