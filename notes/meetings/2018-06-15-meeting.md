## Review actions

- [ ] Review actions; note any issues or blockers
    - Deciding which pending actions should be carried forward
    - Look at list of task planning (2018-05-02-JP-DW-task-planning.md)
    - Formulate new list of actions to carry forward

### Previous actions carried forward

(Actions obviously overtaken by events have been dropped; most of these should be subsumed into a new development plan.)

- [ ] 20180322.4  JP: Add notes about proposal for NiN export triggers to GitHub
    - SHOULD HAVE (would be good for demo)
- [ ] 20180322.8  JP: Multiple/additional working set import and basic display
      - No activity, ongoing, not a vast amount of work to complete, but not urgent
      - NICE TO HAVE for demo
- [x] 20180328.6  JP Fragment assembly / internal score generation (UI and logic)
      - Subsumed by later planning
- [ ] 20180328.7  JP MEI document generation from internal score
      - SHOULD HAVE for demo (but maybe not very visible in demo)
      - NOTE: now assembling multi-part MEI score - affects effort required
      - NOTE: may be affected by decision on action 20180328.8
- [ ] 20180328.8  JP Audio generation from assembled MEI score
      - DEFER consideration: may be superseded by alternative playback optiuon
      - (also note playback is now multi-channel)
- [ ] 20180413.3  JP authenticated access to LDP
    - NOT REQUIRED for demo; but should be addressed before allowing external access to Sofa.  Will probably be provided via HTTP server proxy.
- [x] 20180423.2  JP complete UI for remixer and fregment assembly
      - Subsumed by later planning and design changes
- [x] 20180423.3  JP complete check MEI output and functionality
      - Subsumed by later planning and design changes
- [x] 20180423.4  JP complete and test audio generation from MEI
      - Subsumed by later planning and design changes
      - MUST HAVE audio generation in some form

### Actions from last meeting

n/a

### Additional actions for planning

Column constraints:
    - matching fragment lengths (implicit, no UI)
    - choose other constraints from those available

Row constraints:
    - instrument playability (session setup)
    - key compatibility (enable or not - "stick or twist")
    - choose other constraints from those available ("stick or twist")

UI elements to consider: session setup, column constraints, fragment selection pop-up "stick or twist"

- [ ] 20180615.1  JP UI to display multiple parts (rows in grid)
    - MUST HAVE
    - in progress
- [ ] 20180615.2  JP Code to handle column constraints over fragment grid
    - MUST HAVE
    - in progress
- [ ] 20180615.3  JP Code to handle row constraints over fragment grid
    - MUST HAVE
    - in progress
- [ ] 20180615.4  JP code to handle session setup (session-wide constraint selection)
    - SHOULD HAVE (possible to hard-code?)
    - not started
- [ ] 20180615.5  JP recursive scanning of LDP containers
    - MUST HAVE (because of way agents generate annotations)
    - agents can create; interface filter code in progress
- [ ] 20180615.6  GK extend Annalist musical instrument catalogue to contain ensemble descriptions
    - SHOULD HAVE - see 20180615.7
- [ ] 20180615.7  JP create agent to read ensemble descriptions and generate LDP container to drive remixer UI.  Needs some design work.
    - NICE TO HAVE - demo could use hard-coded instruments for channels OR demo could have specific UI to read Annalist data directly for choices (requires constraint-specific logic in the remixer)
- [ ] 20180615.8  Session setup UI to allow instrument/channel selection
    - NICE TO HAVE - demo could use hard-coded instruments for channels; see also 20180615.7
- [ ] 20180615.9  JP Decide on approach for specifying instrument group (see above three actions .6-.8)
- [ ] 20180615.10 JP Add compatibility agent (annotation service) for instrumentation 
    - MUST HAVE
    - in progress - needs linking to Annalist data


## Review software progress and blockers

Mainly, pick of items hanging over from Sofa paper work

See actions above for specific software components.

Progress has been adversely impacted by VM infrastructure problems.  Currently have NiN running from docker container in desktop.  Still need to set up dockerized LDP containerthat can be run on the system under JP's desktop.  Thus, the dockerized systems can easily be moved to a new VM when that stalilizes.

Compatibility agents for length, key compatibility, etc...  Currently these are run by hand as stand-alone command line applications, paramaterized with working set URI and compatibility service URI. Currently no triggers to auto-run whennew fragment is created.  Currently being run by checking out to some suitable host and run using node.  Could have copies ready-to-run (with node installed) on the demo server.

GK Q: could NiN installation be easier?  Yes, as a docker container.  Hard-coded config configuratiobn is now concentrated in a single config file.  Could use docker files to generate install script.  But a full install package is probably too much effort.  (Will be in Github later today)

Sofa remixer application is all browser side Javascript: needs to be served from somewhere, after transpiling (node server does this on-the fly, but could be pre-built and served statically.)  Therefore currently needs node server to serve content.  Need to have node server for demo server.

Currently agents access Annalist data on fast-project.annalist.net. Could be posisbly configured to use static data export.

ACTION:
- [ ] 20180615.11 JP need complete installation guide for setting up all the software for a stand-alone demo deployment.  Some of this could be pre-build or scripted.
    - in progress 
    - have been working on making install more scriptable, using config file

## Planning for Industry day demo

Note: fully functional demo should be stabilized by 17 August - 9 elapsed weeks from date of this meeting.

### Software development plan

Make note of tasks to be completed for the demo

MUST HAVE / NEEDED

- User interface completion for SAAM paper: includes handling multiple channels/parts/voices, and tying in the row and column constraint filters for fragment selection - 2d

- Recursive scanning of LDP containers - add container indirection logic to annotation scanning/filtering code.  1d.

- Instrument compatibility agent (annotation service) for instrumentation - 2d.
    - needs to scan working set fragments
    - needs to interact with Annalist data
    - needs to set up containers

- UI elements to set up constraints (e.g. instrument/channel assignments, match criteria selection based on available match services) - 3d for initial functionally complete implementation.

- Handle session setup - configuring a session; session-wide constraint selection.  driven from config data - UI is separate.  1d.

- Audio generation for assembled fragments; ability to play the composed work in its current state - 4d (variable due to unknowns)
    - Need to decide via MIDI or via MEI - via MIDI will require MIDI handling library; via MEI looks more complicated (would also need to select samples used, etc.)  Assuming for now to go via MIDI.

- Initial set up data for demonstration.  Saved NiN output data so demo can be run without NiN or separete server active.  Additional data will be added as development work proceeds - 1d (initial setup).

- Create software release (ask Mat to install and test it) - 2d.


SHOULD HAVE

- Propose design for export triggers - 0.5d

- NiN export triggers - SHOULD HAVE (would be good for demo) - ~2d (contingent on design)

- MEI document generation from assembled fragments - 4d

- Session setup UI to allow individual instrument/channel selection - 2d

- Extend Annalist musical instrument catalogue to contain ensemble descriptions - 1d (GK)

- Create some ensemble data - 1d

- Create agent to read ensemble descriptions and generate LDP container - 1d

- Session setup UI to allow ensemble selection (as alternative to individual instrument selection), including loading ensemble data.  NOTE: not adding/editing existing ensemble.  1d.


NICE TO HAVE / NOT REQUIRED for demo

- Multiple/additional working set import - 

- Authenticated access to LDP - 


POST-IMPLEMENTATION IMPROVEMENTS

- Interface tweaking/iteration


### Other tasks required for industry day

- Create visualization of SOFA application music flows (to be discussed - in FAST project meetings?)


## Risks to maintaining progress

Identify potential risks; which can reasonably be mitigated?
(Note: Mat offered to do a trial install of the software)

- system failure

- data loss

- data tied to specific system

- unforeseen complications with software

Mitigations planned to date are

- ease of setup on new systemto avoid dependency on any specific host (using docker)

- data backups

- test data running on localhost

- Docker containers running in alternative VM host (e.g. Trantor environment)
