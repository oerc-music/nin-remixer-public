# Summary and general notes

The SOFA load/save UI work has stalled due to problems with loading data into GOLD.  Code is mostly complete, with a day's worth of integration/testing to wrap up. 

We had already planned to try running SOFA on node-solid-server later today:  if this works, we'll try switching development to that to sidestep the problems with GOLD.

A date for meeting with QMUL about MELD/CALMA has been set for next week (19 Mar).

Mat will look at generating a larger SOFA dataset for demonstration use.

Activities to think about in preparation for the QMUL meeting:

- working set and match service annotation structure diagram to support SOFA/LDP interaction descriptions (cf. [GK4])
- meld-cli tool, work with Gold?  OR...
- SOFA running on Solid (plan to try this on 2019-03-12 with GK+JP in office).  See [GK9].
- Consider what additional features in MELD CLI tool will allow creation of match/annotation services as bash scripts.
- (more?)


# GK

## Previously

- QMul meeting for MELD/CALMA?  (2019-03-19 - finalized)
- MELD CLI tool - no progress since 2018-03-06 [GK5, GK6, GK7, GK1]
- Solid server PR accepted (4-line edit) [GK2] :)

Other:
- Annalist support language-tagged literals
- Annalist GitHub login


## Next/future

- MELD/CALMA meeting at QMUL on 2019-03-19
- MELD CLI tool test suite (Started)
- Add annotation display to MELD CLI tool
- Generic resource creation in MELD CLI tool
- Setup Solid with proper CA localhost certificate
- Improve documentation of Solid and MELD CLI tool setup
- Annalist Solid login
- ???

## Blockers

(None at present)


# JP

## Previously

- trying to finish up SOFA save/load implementation [JP4, JP5]
   - having problems with GOLD loading data (1d used): falls over and ends up with corrupt data (setup scripts are failing now)
   - about a day left, so effectively no progress

## Next

- install Node Solid server; try running SOFA on Solid (today) (0.5d)
- assuming running on Node Solid server goes well, finish up SOFA save/load implementation using that (1d) [JP4, JP5]
- update installation kit and instructions as required (0.5d)
- merge in Mats updates
- with working system; push changes to GitHub

Future:

- Scripts for merging worksets for multiple inputs to a SOFA session [JP6]
    - Will probably look at adding this to MELD-CLI tool [GK5].
- Finish off MEI output

## Blockers

Problems with Gold; lost time


# MW

## Previously

- style and presentation changes to SOFA; pushed to GitHub


## Next

- Generate a larger dataset for deminstration (more fragments, more chance of matching) - automatic generation from NiN

## Blockers

- Will need a session with JP to identify locus of code changes in NiN code. (30mins?)
