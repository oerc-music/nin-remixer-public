With the revised SOFA project plan prepared after last week's meetings, I'm planning on discontinuing the full meeting minutes, as they don't seem to justify the time taken to prepare.

Instead, I'll make notes of key points and issues in the Annalist project plan [1].  Over time, I'll hope to make key information here moire visible, but in the meanwhile you can dig around the tasks for more details.

At our progress meeting today, we noted:

1. a day or so of planned progress was lost due to problems preoparing for the SOFA demo yesterday (see [2]).  As a result, the grid UI completion work is a day or so behind [3].

2. The "SSG output" task [4] schedule start has been brought forward, to be initiated by me in parallel with John's work on the SOFA application.  The goal of this task is documentation and tools that will help other developers to interact with a SOFA-style use of LDP containers of annotations of musical fragments.  I plan to use this activity to also experiment with Solid pods as alternative LDP container servers to the Gold software we currently use.
