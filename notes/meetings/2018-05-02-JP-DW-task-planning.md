JP, DW

## Remixer/SOFA development

- [x] DW: UI to display pop-up with with selection list (for current grid positon)
- [x] JP: UI to display selected segments row-wise
- [.] DW: UI to display multiple parts (rows in grid)
- [.] JP: Code to hand constraints over parts (column of grid)
- [.] JP: Code to handle constraints across part (along row)
- [ ] DW: UI Controls for column constrain (above/below grid)
- [ ] DW: UI row-wise constraint controls (in selection pop-up)
- [x] JP: Update traversal code for potential extra level of recursion
           ? Do we use same motivation value to indicate recusion at higher levels too?
- [x] JP: Add annotation service for length (agent is done; NiN needs tweaking to export length)
- [ ] JP: Add length parameter to NiN output
- [.] JP: Instrument "ontology" linking to pitch range
    - GK created Annalist collection
    - discuss pitch vs notation
    - [investigate QM ontology for vocab, data from wikipedia?]
- [.] JP: Add compatibility agent (annotation service) for instrumentation (using above)
    - Needs discussion of next items
- [ ] JP: Decide on approach for specifying instrument group (advise from DL?)
- [ ] JP: Instrument OR Ensemble/group selection interface
