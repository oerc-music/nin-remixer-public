## Review other activities

JP had chat with DDeR to get NiN running on new VM (chalassa);  plan to get existing app running there.  Done some preparatory admin work for this.

(Use of LDP for NiN outpout requires (maybe) some coordination with DDeR)

Started thinking about what LDP container to run.
Suggest: use W3C wiki as starying point.  Look for easy-to-install basic LDP container support.


## Tech issues needing investigation

LDP container choice - see above.

What are are minimum requirements for unified NiN working set (cf. @@@), based on minimum viable product descrioption (@@@).

Working set import to new working set: by value or by reference (or both)?


## Next steps and timeline

NOTE: industry day demo trial run is 2018-04-28 (7 elapsed weeks from this meeting)

### Next week timeline

Day 1:
LDP container selected, installed and running

Day 2:
Some scripts to load data into LDP, and retrieve (proving LDP load/store capability)

Day 3:
Initial minimal working set content design
Scripts to create sample working set

Day 4:
Transfer data from NiN into working set in LDP container (started, maybe not finished)

### Overall rough timeline

Week 1: LDP container stood up, with executable scripts or equivalent to create a prototype working set.  Have two things that can be iterated: toolkit for making a working set, and data model for same.

Start on import from NiN

Week 2:
Import from NiN
Core UI for remixer
- single working set import/load and basic display
- multiple working set import and basic display

Week 3:
Simple fragment compatibility service (focus on interface)
Core UI for remixer
- fragment assembly / score generation

Week 4:

Audio generation from current "score"
MEI document generation ("score")
Core UI for remixer
- audio playback

Week 5:

DMO Export logic
Core UI for remixer
- DMO export
Integration, testing and improvement
MVP demoable

Week 6:

MVP reviewed and tweaked
