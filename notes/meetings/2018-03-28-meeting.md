    - not started: blocked on 20180322.9


## Review software progress and blockers

### Complete single working set load and basic display

Done.  No special notes; expect some tweaks iand adjustments in due course.

Currently running local install of GoLD, not on Thalassa (NiN server).

Plan to install on public server on different port so it's not wide-open (with Apache proxy and access control)

ACTION: JP deploy GoLD to Thalassa, load data, send link for record

### Multiple/additional working set import and basic display

Ongoing.  No blockers.  Following model discussed last time (i.e. import named working set to current active working set)

### Fragment compatibility service interface design

Given some thought.  Needs discussion.  What do LDP containers give us here?

See more detailed discussion below.

### Initial fragment compatibility service implementation

(Not started yet - blocked on design discussion)


## Match architecture interface discussion

(Fragment compatibility service interface design)

See [Match-Architecture.md](../Match-Architecture.md) added notes: these suggests some linked data models for representing the match options.

GK: I think we need to separate the match service implementation from the interface that is used to access matches.  Ideally, the interface would be independent of match criteria details, and unioform across different criteria.

Interface parameters leading to match candidate selection:

1. working set
2. match criterion
3. target fragment to be matched

Our discussion led to a design using nested LDP containers with annotations, and a common interface that involves filtering on a given annotation target:

Match service (LDP container)
-> Match-workset-resource (LDP container)
-> Match-criterion-resource (LDP container)
-> Match candidate (target:probe fragmnent, body:matchable-fragment) (Web annotation)

Thus, in operation:

1. POST with a working set URI to the match service creates a `Match-workset-resource`. (Per [LDP spec 5.2.3.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/#ldpc-container) this will involve posting a reprentation of the container object, with RDF that includes the working set URI.  The LDO server creates a `Match-workset-resource` and returns its URI in a `Location` header field.  Also note the request header must contain a `Link` fiekld specifying the interaction model `http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#BasicContainer`; e.g.

        Link: http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#BasicContainer;rel=type

    (See example 6 at http://www.w3.org/TR/ldp-primer/#creating-containers-and-structural-hierarchy, though I think the Limnk: headerr field in the response example may be wrong)

2. POST with a match criterion identifier (thus, each criterion needs an identifier) to a `Match-workset-resource` container creates a `Match-criterion-resource` container.  (Again, this will involve posting container description with an appropriate `Link:` header field)

3. POST a match annotation to a `Match-criterion-resource` container will create a match candidate entry.

We believe this approach will work reasonably with the linked data model ideas added in [Match-Architecture.md](../Match-Architecture.md).  For now, we are assuming that entries in LDP containers will be selected by scanning and filtering.  Something to bear in mind for future scaling is the provision of a server-side "find all annotations targeting resource X": as far as possible, data model designs for container contents should consider that this might be a porimnary method for getting at container contents.

See:
- [Remixer fragment matching model and selection criteria](../20180328-nin-remixer-match-model.jpg)
- [Remixer components and separation of interface from implementation](../20180328-nin-remixer-match-components.jpg)

(The diagrams are not very self explanatory: see above discussion for more detailsd.)

ACTION: GK/JP upload whiteboard images to GitHub

ACTION: GK create design diagrams (may take a while)

### Additional comment added later by GK

In view of the LDP container content-selection comment above, I'm thinking of something like the following for the various container contents

- Match service: Web anotation (target: working set, body: match-workset-resource)
- Match-workset-resource: Web anotation (target: match-criterion-identifier, body: match-criterion-resource)
- Match-criterion-resource: Web annotation (target: selected-fragment, body: candidate match fragment) - with multiple instances for a given selected fragment

Thus, I think the primary access mechanism in each case can be: find all annotatiions that target a specified resource.

## Next steps and timeline

NOTE: industry day demo trial run is 2018-04-26

### Next week timeline

Transfer LDP service on Thalassa (0.5d)

Simple fragment compatibility service (focus on service interface)
- service implementation (possibly completed following meeting) (0.5d)

Core UI for remixer
- fragment assembly / score generation (UI to build internal composed sequence) (1.5d)

MEI document generation ("score")
- (rearranging XML documents - this is a bit of an unknown) (0.5..2.0d)

Audio generation from current "score"
- requires MEI; have pieces available to play MEI (with bug) (0.5d)
- (if MEI is problematic, could fall back to playing fragments sequentially)

Core UI for remixer
- audio playback (roll in to previous)

Core UI for remixer
- multiple working set import and basic display (0.5d)
- (not urgent for demo)

(Looking tight but possible - the greatest risk appears to be the MEI manipulation)

### Overall rough timeline

- Week 4: (starting Mon 2018-04-09)

    Core UI for remixer
    - fragment assembly / score generation
    Audio generation from current "score"
    MEI document generation ("score")
    Core UI for remixer
    - audio playback

- Week 5: (starting Mon 2018-04-16)

    DMO Export logic
    Core UI for remixer
    - DMO export
    Integration, testing and improvement
    Minimum viable product (MVP) demoable

- Week 6: (starting 2018-04-23)

    Minimum viable product (MVP) reviewed and tweaked
