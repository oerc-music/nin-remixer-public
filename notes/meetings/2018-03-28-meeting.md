# Non-meeting-notes

The following notes are included here as a record of what we actually discussed in the meeting, as opposed to a revised version that appears above.

### SAAM paper

Thinking about beyond the April demo to the music/semantics/workshop at SWeb conference (SAAM, Monterey) - submission deadline mid-May.  Possible paper with Kevin/David  using what we've built as a base for a demo/talk that explores the related technology options (e.g. fragment matching)for a SWeb audience.

Aiming to be ready by 17 April to start sketching paper outline (FAST project meeting).

(KP?) has expectation that parts of what comes out of this will fold back into main MELD work; e.g. look for capabilities that we develop for NiN remixer which could be incorporated into MELD reference implementations.

Possibility that NiN remixer fragment match annotations coulkd be run on MELD infrastructure.  Should be able to remix and recombine ideas from both/all strands.  (E.g.?) How do we deal with session users and fragments (e.g. link to agents in MELD sessions).

Want to have discussion before Easter; hence DW joining us at next meeting

NOT-ACTION: JP provide DW, and circulate GK/KP/DDeR with pointers to tech work to date (e.g. annotated list of links)

NOT-ACTION: GK create wiki page for ideas for future directions of NiN-remixer

NOT-ACTION: GK/JP add JP circulated notes as background to future ideas page

NOT-ACTION: ALL make notes of any ideas in new wiki page
