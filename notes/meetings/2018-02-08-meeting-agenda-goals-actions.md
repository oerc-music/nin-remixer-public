# Agenda

The overall aim of thid meeting will be to capture enough information about the proposed Numbers-into-Notes application to be able to make reasoned judgements about applicability of data modelling options and applicability of MELD ideas, and to provide a sharable baseline for subsequent discussion of technical issues.  I think a non-goal at this stage is to actually try to do a MELD mapping. 

0. Agenda/goals review (5)

1. Name (and slug/repo name) (5-10)

  - create github repo for recording notes?

2. User stories (15-20)

    - 5-10 should get us started

3. Usage scenario outlines (30)

4. Minimal viable product features (15)

5. High-level architecture/sketch (60)


# Actions

- [x] GK - agenda and notes to github repo
- [x] GK - README for repo with links to other docs
- [x] JP/GK - copy of whiteboard photos to GitHub repo (as placeholders)
- [ ] JP - "architecture" diagrams from whiteboard sketches (e.g., for presentation)
- [ ] JP/All - propose possible match "architecture" elements to MELD and related web/LD ideas
- [ ] JP - presentation for FAST meeting (10-15 minutes?)



# Goals

1.  Agree on a suitable name we can use to describe the application (e.g. "Numbers into notes remixer"?). 

2.  An initial set of user stories to capture some user requirements for the application. 

    I propose we should capture as many as occur to us without (a) attempting to be comprehensive, or (b) making any kind of promise that all of these will be addressed in an initial implementation. 

    I like using the template: 

      "As a {stakeholder type} I want {some feature} so that I can {some goal}" 

    I find this helps to keep the initial requirements focused on users and other stakeholders, and connected to goals that are meaningful to them, without prejudging the technical implementation. 

    I don't think the list needs to be long (probably best if it isn't!).  I think it would help if we can come to the meeting with any additional thoughts, which we can talk through, and possibly through such discussion expose more. 

3.  Some outline usage scenarios that give a sense of what it might be like to use the <NiN remixer>.  Like the user stories, these wouldn't be comprehensive or imply any expectation to implement. 

    These should be brief: just enough to expose the anticipated user interactions with the system to give a sense of what steps a user might be expected to perform.  It would help if you could bring a sketch of a usage scenario based on the application as developed for the FAST all-hands in December.  (I anticipate 5-10 1-sentence steps.) 


4.  Suggest a "minimal viable product" (minimal in the sense of being able to support some remixing activity) drawing upon the identified requirements and scenarios. 


5.  Generate a high-level technical architecture sketch, identifying key components (without specific reference to MELD ideas - the point being to subsequently test which elements are a sensible fit with MELD ideas). 


6.  Capture the generated ideas in a github repo (creating one if it does not already exist).  (I suggest github, as I find this an easy, low-overhead way to share notes, code and data.  If you don't already have a repo for this, I'd be happy to create one.)
