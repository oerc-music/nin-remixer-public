    - 2018-05-01 15:00
    - Note: this is also day for scheduled office move
- [ ] Review agenda
- [ ] Review actions; note any issues or blockers
- [ ] Review software progress
- [ ] Planning for SAAM paper
- [ ] Review and revise timeline

### Resolutions

### Previous actions carried forward

- [ ] 20180322.4   JP: Add notes about proposal for NiN export triggers to GitHub
      - this isn't so urgent, may be allowed to drift
- [ ] 20180322.8   JP: Multiple/additional working set import and basic display
      - No activity, ongoing, not a vast amount of work to complete, but not urgent
      - deferred until after demo rehearsal

- [ ] 20180328.6   JP Fragment assembly / internal score generation (UI and logic) (1.5d)
    - mostly done, hoping to complete today
- [ ] 20180328.7   JP MEI document generation from internal score (uncertain: 0.5 - 2.0d)
    - started; partly done; needs confirmation that MEI is functional; hoping to complete today
- [ ] 20180328.8   JP Audio generation from MEI score (0.5d)
    - looked at previous working code; con luded that it should port OK.
    - blocked on 20180328.8

- [ ] 20180413.3  JP authenticated access to LDP
    - not an immediate requirement, but should be addressed before allowing external access to remixer.  Will probably be provided via HTTP server proxy.

### New actions

ACTION: JP complete UI for remixer and fregment assembly (0.5d)

ACTION: JP complete check MEI output and functionality (0.5d)

ACTION: JP complete and test audio generation from MEI (0.5d)

ACTION: JP demo setup preparation and testing (0.5d)

ACTION: JP industry day demo trial run on 2018-04-26

ACTION: JP (arising from SAAM meeting) add simple new match services to demo system.
    - For this week, to be progressed as and when time permits.

(Other actions are continuation of current development work.)

## Review software progress and blockers

Simple fragment compatibility service done.

Core UI for remixer and fregment assembly:

- mostly done; should complete 2018-04-23
- no blockers

MEI generation:

- mostly done; need to check MEI functionality; should complete 2018-04-23

Audio generation from current "score", and core UI for remixer audio playback:

- awaiting MEI
- already have code from previous demo that should do the job

## Planning for SAAM paper

Discussion took place last Friday (2018-05-20): KP, DW, JP

Need to be able to prove the architecture beyong just key compatibility.  Need to expand the set of match services, and some adaptation to the UI to accommodate multiple compatibility options.

Ideas about "stick or twist" interface - modal interface for match criteria selection? (GK: then, should current "mode" be saved in session state?)

Best case for tech uses linked semantics (see below ++)

Do some of the match cases make sense only with multiplr working sets?

Also discussed modeling of NiN and currenty MELD usage:
- some of the matching types might not be binary; e.g. quantified values - may need some review of match arch model?  (E.g. how to represent quantifued match in an annotation?)

ACTION arising from SAAM paper meeting: JP as and when time permits, add simple new match services to demo system.

### Priorities for match dimensions:

(Based on SAAM paper meeting notes)

1. Key (current implementation)
2. Length (of fragment in notes)
3. Social (by user id) ++ (?)
4. Pitch-range (requires instrument taxonomy) ++
    + With multi-part constraints
5. NiN scale mapping
6. NiN algorithm mapping
7. Start/end note ("modifiers"?) with pitch window
8. Time signatures (n.b. Block on DdeR)

## Next steps and timeline

### Next week timeline

Complete UI for remixer and fregment assembly (0.5d)

Complete check MEI outout and functionality (0.5d)

Complete and test audio generation from MEI (0.5d)

Demo setup preparation and testing (0.5d)

Final tweaks to system

Industry day demo trial run on 2018-04-26

Add simple new match services to system, as time permits


### Overall rough timeline

- Week 6: (starting 2018-04-23)

    Complete core UI for remixer
    - finish fragment assembly / score generation
    Complete MEI document generation ("score")
    Complete audio playback

    Minimum viable product (MVP) reviewed and tweaked, and ready for demo rehearsal.

    Demo at QMUL

- Deferred to later

    DMO Export logic and UI
    - may drop this unless there a clear requirement arises

    Multiple working set import and basic display (0.5d)

- After demo: work for SAAM paper
