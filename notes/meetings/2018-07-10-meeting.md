## Review actions

Review actions; note any issues or blockers

### Previous actions carried forward

- [ ] 20180322.4  JP: Add notes about proposal for NiN export triggers to GitHub
    - SHOULD HAVE (would be good for demo)
- [ ] 20180322.8  JP: Multiple/additional working set import and basic display
      - No activity, ongoing, not a vast amount of work to complete, but not urgent
      - NICE TO HAVE for demo
- [ ] 20180328.7  JP MEI document generation from internal score
      - SHOULD HAVE for demo (but maybe not very visible in demo)
      - NOTE: now assembling multi-part MEI score - affects effort required
      - NOTE: may be affected by decision on action 20180328.8
- [ ] 20180328.8  JP Audio generation from assembled MEI score
      - DEFER consideration: may be superseded by alternative playback optiuon
      - (also note playback is now multi-channel)
- [ ] 20180413.3  JP authenticated access to LDP
    - NOT REQUIRED for demo; but should be addressed before allowing external access to Sofa.  Will probably be provided via HTTP server proxy.

### Actions from last meeting

- [ ] 20180615.1  JP UI to display multiple parts (rows in grid)
    - MUST HAVE
    - in progress
- [ ] 20180615.2  JP Code to handle column constraints over fragment grid
    - MUST HAVE
    - in progress
- [ ] 20180615.3  JP Code to handle row constraints over fragment grid
    - MUST HAVE
    - in progress
- [ ] 20180615.4  JP code to handle session setup (session-wide constraint selection)
    - SHOULD HAVE (possible to hard-code?)
    - not started
- [ ] 20180615.5  JP recursive scanning of LDP containers
    - MUST HAVE (because of way agents generate annotations)
    - agents can create; interface filter code in progress
- [ ] 20180615.6  GK extend Annalist musical instrument catalogue to contain ensemble descriptions
    - SHOULD HAVE - see 20180615.7
- [ ] 20180615.7  JP create agent to read ensemble descriptions and generate LDP container to drive remixer UI.  Needs some design work.
    - NICE TO HAVE - demo could use hard-coded instruments for channels OR demo could have specific UI to read Annalist data directly for choices (requires constraint-specific logic in the remixer)
- [ ] 20180615.8  Session setup UI to allow instrument/channel selection
    - NICE TO HAVE - demo could use hard-coded instruments for channels; see also 20180615.7
- [ ] 20180615.9  JP Decide on approach for specifying instrument group (see above three actions .6-.8)
- [ ] 20180615.10 JP Add compatibility agent (annotation service) for instrumentation 
    - MUST HAVE
    - in progress - needs linking to Annalist data
- [ ] 20180615.11 JP need complete installation guide for setting up all the software for a stand-alone demo deployment.  Some of this could be pre-build or scripted.
    - in progress 
    - have been working on making install more scriptable, using config file


## Review software progress and blockers


## @@@@


## Software development plan / priorities

(Details copied forward from last meeting)

Make note of tasks to be completed for the demo

MUST HAVE / NEEDED

- User interface completion for SAAM paper: includes handling multiple channels/parts/voices, and tying in the row and column constraint filters for fragment selection - 2d

- Recursive scanning of LDP containers - add container indirection logic to annotation scanning/filtering code.  1d.

- Instrument compatibility agent (annotation service) for instrumentation - 2d.
    - needs to scan working set fragments
    - needs to interact with Annalist data
    - needs to set up containers

- UI elements to set up constraints (e.g. instrument/channel assignments, match criteria selection based on available match services) - 3d for initial functionally complete implementation.

- Handle session setup - configuring a session; session-wide constraint selection.  driven from config data - UI is separate.  1d.

- Audio generation for assembled fragments; ability to play the composed work in its current state - 4d (variable due to unknowns)
    - Need to decide via MIDI or via MEI - via MIDI will require MIDI handling library; via MEI looks more complicated (would also need to select samples used, etc.)  Assuming for now to go via MIDI.

- Initial set up data for demonstration.  Saved NiN output data so demo can be run without NiN or separete server active.  Additional data will be added as development work proceeds - 1d (initial setup).

- Create software release (ask Mat to install and test it) - 2d.


SHOULD HAVE

- Propose design for export triggers to initiate creation of annotations - 0.5d

- NiN export triggers - SHOULD HAVE (would be good for demo) - 2d (contingent on design)

- MEI document generation from assembled fragments - 4d

- Session setup UI to allow individual instrument/channel selection - 2d

- Extend Annalist musical instrument catalogue to contain ensemble descriptions - 1d (GK)

- Create some ensemble data - 1d

- Create agent to read ensemble descriptions and generate LDP container - 1d

- Session setup UI to allow ensemble selection (as alternative to individual instrument selection), including loading ensemble data.  NOTE: not adding/editing existing ensemble.  1d.


NICE TO HAVE / NOT REQUIRED for demo

- Multiple/additional working set import - 

- Authenticated access to LDP - 


POST-IMPLEMENTATION IMPROVEMENTS

- Interface tweaking/iteration


### Other tasks required for industry day

- Create visualization of SOFA application music flows (to be discussed - in FAST project meetings?)


## Risk management planning

(Details reformatted and reviewed from last meeting)

### System failure

- ease of setup on new system to avoid dependency on any specific host (using docker)

- have test data running on localhost

- try to ensure data can be ported

- Docker containers running in alternative VM host (e.g. Trantor environment)

- Codify LDP container service setup so it can be re-applied elsehwere (e.g. other apps).

### Data loss

- data backups

### Unforeseen complications with software

(Not sure what this meant.  Our software, or dependencies? #g)

- regular status reviews


### Developer availability

- documentation?

- automation (scripting)?

- installation by another dev (Mat offered to do a trial install of the software)


## Next steps and timeline
