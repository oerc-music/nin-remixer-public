# Simple sequential composition scenario (ala Dec 2017)

- export a number of "piano roll" fragments from Numbers into Notes

- start nin-remixer with a (possibly empty) collection of fragments available (selected?) [as a working set?]

- play some of the fragments

- select an initial fragment to start the composition

- system offers potential next fragments based on "compatible" key

- play some of the offered fragments

- sleect a fragment to come next in the composition

- repeat and rinse

- play entire composition

- export resulting composition as "DMO" (maybe as link, or maybe as data)


# Simple (expanded) composition scenario

- export a number of "piano roll" fragments from Numbers into Notes

    - (Push from NiN, or pull everything from NiN into another interface, or something else - unspecified as yet)

- start nin-remixer with a (possibly empty) collection of fragments available (selected?) [as a working set?]

- play some of the working set fragments

- select an initial fragment to be part of the composition; fragment is inserted into an open-ended timeline.  

- System places cursor following the inserted fragment

- system offers compatible fragments to appear at the cursor

    - e.g. based on "compatible" key

- User may:
    
    - listen to any of the offered fragments 
    - select one of the offered fragments to be inserted into the timeline
    - select a different position in the timeline; the set of offered fragments is updated
    - switch to NiN interface to create a new fragment, and subsequently add to working set
    - remove a fragment from the composition
    - play some or all of the entire composition so far
    - change compability model for offered fragments

- Repeat and rinse

- export resulting composition as "DMO" (maybe as link, or maybe as data)


# Other features

- offer multiple dimensions of compatibility

- social aspects (sharing, collaboration, etc.)
