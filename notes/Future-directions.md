# Possible future directions

## Alternative fragment rematching options

(Including drawing upon Sonic annotator (?) capabilities)

(Think about implications of asymmetricm and non-transitive criteria (like simple key compatibility)

(Think about matches that involve specific before-and-after fragments)


## Incorporate MELD sessions

## Provenance trace across MELD sessions

(Capture and record the path of data through various system users)

## Scaling up

Initial designs assume a relatively small number of fragments in a wqorking set...

e.g. server-side annotation target filtering?
