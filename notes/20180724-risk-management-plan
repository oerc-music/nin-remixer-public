## Risk management planning

(Details reformatted and reviewed from last meeting)

### System failure

- ease of setup on new system to avoid dependency on any specific host (using docker)

- have test data running on localhost

- try to ensure data can be ported

- Docker containers running in alternative VM host (e.g. Trantor environment)

- Codify LDP container service setup so it can be re-applied elsehwere (e.g. other apps).

### Data loss

- data backups (including setup and config)

- Currently backing up to m/c in Phonetics

### Unforeseen complications with software

(Not sure what this meant.  Our software, or dependencies? #g)

- regular status reviews


### Developer availability

- documentation?

- automation (scripting)?

- installation by another dev (Mat offered to do a trial install of the software)
